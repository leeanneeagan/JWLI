				<h2>Our History</h2>
				<p>
					The Japanese Women's Leadership Initiative (WLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary women in
					Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings
					emerging women leaders, referred to as the Fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of
					hands-on experience and training with successful nonprofit organizations in nonprofit management and
					leadership development. During their stay in Boston, the Fellows will develop an Action Plan, which
					will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to make their dreams of social change a reality. After
					returning to Japan, the Fellows are expected to make a difference in their communities based on
					their Action Plans. The purpose of this program is for the fellows to share the knowledge and
					experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders within Japan.
					The Fish Family Foundation, operating in conjunction with other Boston-based nonprofit
					organizations, is administering /WLI in partnership with Simmons College School of Management's
					Center for Gender in Organizations.
					In 2010, thanks to the generous funding provided by the U.S. - Japan Foundation,
					JwLI expanded its vision to nola
					public torums within Japan. Held In 2010,
					2012 and 2013, these public forums provided information
					about the nonprofit sector and the American approach to philanthropy
					with hopes to inspire women to take leadership roles. The Forum Program
					reached hundreds of Japanese citizens, aavocating for their invo vement
					in addressing une neeas or japanese society.</p>
